    <p>Khajiit (from Ta'agra, meaning desert-dweller) are cat-like people who come from Elsweyr, known for high intelligence and agility. These traits make them very good thieves and acrobats, but Khajiit are also fearsome warriors. They are rarely known to be mages. Khajiit mostly stay on land, but piracy and Skooma trade does draw some to work as sailors.

Khajiit anatomy differs greatly from both men and mer, not only because of their fur, tail, and sometimes toe-walking stance, but also their digestive system and metabolism. Khajiit, Argonians, and Imga are the so-called "beast races" of Tamriel because of these large differences. Khajiit have a lifespan similar to that of humans. There are no well-documented cases of cross-breeding between Khajiit and other races, though there are rumors of such a thing. The foreign appearance and behavior of Khajiit make them common targets of racial discrimination, being given the name Cat-Men by foreigners, which the Khajiit don't take lightly.</p>

      <h2>Morphology and furstocks</h2>
      <p>
        The morphology of Khajiit is determined at their date of birth rather than the shape of their parents.It is intrinsically tied to the phases of Jone and Jode and the Lunar Lattice, also known as the ja-Kha'jay. After birth, Khajiit look very similar to one another and are smaller than human newborns. Within weeks, their individual morphology becomes more clear, and their growth is faster than that of humans. The lifespan of Khajiit is around the same as men.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are seventeen distinct "furstocks", different variations of Khajiit, although the Imperial Geographical Society has previously claimed that there are more than twenty. Furstocks with the suffix of -raht are generally bigger than their non -raht counterparts. Common to all Khajiit is their weakness for sweets, especially Moon Sugar. Different furstocks can engage in romantic pairings, though some can prove to be more physically challenging than others.

          <h3>Alfiq</h3>
          <img src='https://images.uesp.net/thumb/6/60/LG-cardart-Alfiq_Illusionist_02.jpg/600px-LG-cardart-Alfiq_Illusionist_02.jpg' alt='An Alfiq khajiit conjuring the illusion of itself' title='Alfiq'>
          <p>
            The Alfiq are a diminutive form of magically gifted Khajiit resembling typical housecats. Their resemblance to common housecats has led many to treat them as such, whether by downplaying their intelligence, cooing at them or attempting to cuddle them. Alfiq have even been kidnapped by non-Khajiit who think they're cute and take them home as pets. While it is rumored among outsiders that Alfiq are mute, they are in fact capable of speech. The misconception that Alfiq are incapable of speech may derive from the scholarly reduction of Alfiq to the status of housecats, or from a disinclination of Alfiq to talk in the presence of outsiders. Due to the disrespect that Alfiq get as a result of their form, they rarely travel outside Elsweyr.

          <h3>Alfiq-raht</h3>
          Nothing is known of the Alfiq-raht except that they are probably bigger than the Alfiq. Expression "as crazy as an Alfiq-raht in heat" was used in Second Era.

          <h3>Cathay</h3>

          <p>
            Cathay are slightly larger and stronger than Suthay-raht, but the most obvious difference is that they have plantigrade legs.

            Khajiit of this furstock were nicknamed as "jaguar-men" by the Imperial Geographical Society. They are said to be more agile than a werewolf.

          <h3>Dagi</h3>

          <p>
            Dagi are a less common form of the Khajiit, living in the southern marshes and jungle regions of Elsweyr, as well as the Tenmar Forest. Physically, they have facial features that are comparable to that of lynxes and are short in stature, making them among the smallest of the furstocks. Due to their light weight, they have been reported as being able to dwell in higher branches of trees that cannot hold a Bosmer. Due to their inclination to climb trees, they are compared to monkeys, though this is considered insulting. However, some folklore claims that a mummified Dagi paw can grant wishes at a price, mirroring the stories of Monkey paws among the Bosmer. According to possibly unreliable reports from the Bosmer, Dagi are suspected to be skilled spellcasters.
